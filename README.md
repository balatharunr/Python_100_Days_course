# Python_100_Days_course
This repository contains my daily practice projects from Angela Yu’s “100 Days of Code: Python” course on Udemy.  Each folder (Day01, Day02, …) includes the code I wrote while learning Python fundamentals, automation, games, and small applications. The purpose of this repo is to track my learning progress and organize all course work in one place.
